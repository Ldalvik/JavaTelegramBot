# JavaTelegramBot
Full java open source code for the telegram bot @root\_its\_unobb\_famBot / @TheEpsilonBot
You know the drill, put your bot username and token in the BotConfig.class and import the .jar files. Ignore the .json files, those are from the people who used /score and logged their score. If you have any questions, suggestions or problems, run it by me on instagram @java.lang.String
